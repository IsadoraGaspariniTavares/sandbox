                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flour</li>
                        <li>Active fry yeast</li>
                        <li>Water</li>
                        <li>Sugar</li>
                        <li>Sea salt</li>
                        <li> Extra-Virgin oil</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                    <p>Making this pizza dough recipe is easy! Here’s what you need to do:</p>
                    <p>First, proof the yeast. Stir together the yeast, warm water, and sugar in a small bowl. Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy. Heads up: if the yeast doesn’t foam, it’s likely expired. Discard the mixture and try again with a new package of yeast for the best results.</p>
                    <p>Next, make the dough. Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Pour in the yeast mixture and a tablespoon of olive oil. Mix until the dough forms a ball around the hook, 5 to 6 minutes. If the dough is too wet and sticky to form a ball, mix in a little more flour. If it’s dry, add water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time.</p>
                    <p>Then, let it rise. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and use your hands to form it into a smooth ball. Brush a large bowl with olive oil, and set the dough ball inside. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set the dough aside to rise until it doubles in size, about 1 hour. Tip: it’ll rise best somewhere warm, like a sunny kitchen countertop!</p>

                    <h2>Homemade Toppings</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Margherita Pizza – With local cherry tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and basil from the backyard, this classic pizza is juicy, slightly sweet & totally delicious.</li>
                        <li>Roasted Red Pepper Pesto Pizza – Using mint & basil from outside, I blended up a super green pesto that paired perfectly with Wisconsin smoked mozzarella & homemade roasted red peppers. I couldn’t resist adding some extra mint leaves for garnish!</li>
                        <li>Peach & Basil Pizza – I’m head over heels for peaches, so with all the basil outside, I had to make this super simple peach & basil pie. Dollops of the pesto from the red pepper pizza added just the right finishing touch here too!</li>
